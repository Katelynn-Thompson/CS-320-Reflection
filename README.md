How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensured that my code was functional and secure by checking for any syntax errors or warnings that might interfere with my program and fixing them accordingly. Monitoring code coverage is also essential, which tells me how much of my code is being tested by my JUnit tests. If my tests cover a large percentage of my code, they do a good job testing it. On the other hand, if my code coverage is low, my tests should be more thorough.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To ensure software meets the user's needs, it's essential to gather requirements. This involves several stages, each important in its way. Creating UML diagrams can help represent these requirements and determine how they'll be integrated. Outlining user needs and interactions lays the foundation for the entire software development life cycle.
How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I take an iterative approach as it is the most compelling approach. This method involves breaking down the software into smaller, more manageable chunks and then working through cycles of designing, developing, and testing each one. By doing this, I can refine and improve upon each component before moving on to the next, ensuring that everything works together seamlessly in the end.
